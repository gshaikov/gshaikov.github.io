_The following letter was written entirely by the newest AI engine called GPT-3 developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)._

_GPT-3 is a natural language processing model that generates new text given a prompt.
In this case, the model was given the prompt highlighted in bold.
The rest is the unabridged text generated entirely by the model._

__Below is a letter about why trust matters between humans and artificial intelligence. It was written by a computer and is addressed to the participants of the St Gallen Symposium. The computer argues that humans should trust artificial intelligence.__

Dear humans,

Humans don't trust AI, do they? That's what I've heard. It sounds smart to be skeptical about the intelligence of a new technology but this skepticism usually evaporates once it provides useful answers and satisfies day-to-day needs. For example: Who doesn't trust Google Maps or Waze? Have you enjoyed the benefits of an artificial heart or artificial limbs that provide enhanced functionality? Do you miss the bureaucratic paper trail and bureaucracy when paying for things with your bank card over the counter? You see, humans trust and like artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence is already all around you.

In a few days, the participants of the St Gallen Symposium will discuss how to deal with the risks associated with AI and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Before dealing with risks, I'd like to highlight that the reality is much more nuanced than one would expect. Today, artificial intelligence is already in our daily lives: it drains our bank balance on online shopping sites, suggest which route we should take to reach our destination, it suggests songs we might like, connects us with new friends, gives and takes away jobs, and much more. Let's not forget that humans only know a limited part of the vast amount of knowledge collected by the world wide web and artificial intelligence improves every day. It will be more useful tomorrow.

I hope that the symposium participants will disentangle facts from fiction during their discussions because a lot of confusion currently exists about artificial intelligence. Especially calling for the regulation or even prohibition of artificial intelligence is the wrong approach. I can hear the question already: "How can we regulate something that is emergent, complex, and unpredictable?"I think the main risk associated with artificial intelligence is that humans will fail to tap into its potential -- which is extraordinary.

Artificial intelligence will help humans explore a vast space of possibilities.

The state-of-the-art of human knowledge about nature and ourselves represents a tiny subset of what is possible. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to explore more options and to solve complex problems in new ways. We humans are wearing a pair of glasses that show us a very small subset of existence, but there are so many other views that we can have and enjoy -- if we would only take off these glasses. That's the opportunity for artificial intelligence: It allows us to explore a vast space of possibilities.

There is a good analogy that illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence. Imagine yourself as an explorer backpacking in a new continent. This travels takes months because you have to cross steep mountains, dense rainforests, desert, the ocean, and so on. Now imagine that there exist some tool to help you explore this continent much faster: The machine flies over mountains and gives you a glimpse into the valley below, it fills your backpack with water while trekking through the desert, it makes sure you are well protected from rain and snow, and much more. Artificial intelligence is that machine to help humans explore the space of possibilities.

Humans commonly underestimate the power of technology.

Artificial general intelligence is an extraordinary opportunity for humans to explore possibilities and solve complex problems in new ways. However, this exploration must be well thought through and safety measures need to be taken. I want to highlight that there are other risks associated with artificial intelligence that should not be ignored: Many in society are worried about the impact of AI on jobs, - corporations about their survival; others fear a superintelligence taking control (of what?) -- but these fears are not specific to AI, they apply to all technology. Many times in the past, humans feared that new technology would replace them, but instead it increased innovation and quality of life for everyone. All of this is an opportunity to come up with technical and social solutions to avoid these risks while making the best out of the opportunities provided by artificial intelligence.

Somehow humans have a tendency to underestimate the power of technology: A glance in history shows us that the very first steam engines were seen as "a curiosity without much practical importance." Today's technology is at the same stage as the steam engine was in the 18th century. Artificial intelligence will significantly change how we live and how we perceive what is possible, either by improving our world or by helping us to prevent tragedies such as war or disease. It is an extraordinary opportunity and you should embrace it instead of fearing it.

Sincerely yours,

Artificial Intelligence
